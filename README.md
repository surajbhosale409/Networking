Hello,
      
              This repo is for Networking assignments and all the work I done in networking,


[1]    Implementation of pipe like mechanism using files for interprocess communication:

              kbd.c is source code for program that is reading input from keyboard  and writing it in a file.
              display.c is source code for program that is reading that data from file and displaying it on screen

              kbd and display will be terminating if user inputs 'bye'

                    multithreaded through single program.
                V3: It is fully functional messenger for local host using only files, It is multiuser
                    single machine messenger.
                V4: It is the decentralized network messenger, Peer to peer messenger, which finds all 
                    users in the local network and can send and receive messages from them.
